There are several frameworks for digital transformation strategies, each with its own approach and focus. Here are a few examples:

McKinsey's 7S Framework:
This framework is based on seven elements that need to be aligned for a successful digital transformation. These elements are: strategy, structure, systems, staff, style, skills, and shared values. The framework helps organizations to identify the gaps in their current state and create a roadmap for a successful transformation.

Prosci's ADKAR Model:
The ADKAR model is a change management framework that focuses on the individual's journey through change. It stands for Awareness, Desire, Knowledge, Ability, and Reinforcement. This framework helps organizations to understand the different stages of change that individuals go through and to create strategies that support them at each stage.

Gartner's Pace-Layered Application Strategy:
This framework is designed to help organizations manage the complexity of their digital transformation journey. The framework classifies applications into three layers: systems of record (stable and slow-changing), systems of differentiation (flexible and changing), and systems of innovation (agile and experimental). The framework helps organizations to prioritize their investments and resources based on the different layers.

Kotter's 8-Step Model for Change:
This framework is designed to help organizations manage change in a structured and effective way. The eight steps are: create a sense of urgency, build a guiding coalition, form a strategic vision and initiatives, enlist a volunteer army, enable action by removing barriers, create short-term wins, consolidate gains and produce more change, and anchor new approaches in the organization's culture. This framework helps organizations to create a roadmap for a successful transformation by breaking down the change into manageable steps.

Digital Maturity Model:
This framework is designed to help organizations assess their current digital maturity and create a roadmap for improvement. The model defines five stages of digital maturity: beginner, intermediate, advanced, leading, and digital transformation. The framework helps organizations to identify their strengths and weaknesses and prioritize their investments and resources based on their level of maturity.

These are just a few examples of frameworks for digital transformation strategies. Each framework has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of framework will depend on the organization's specific needs and goals. It's important to note that a successful digital transformation requires a combination of different frameworks and approaches, customized to the organization's unique context and culture.
